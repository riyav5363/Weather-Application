This is a Weather Application which is a full stack web application.
I have selected React as the front-end framework and Spring Boot as the back-end framework. 
Here is an overview on how to run the project :
  
For Backend:
- Make sure you have one of the IDE's installed in your system, I had used IntelliJ IDEA
- Open weatherapplicationbackend folder in IntelliJ IDEA
- After that run right click on main file and run the project
- The backend will start running on port 8080 by default

For Frontned:
- Use can use Visual Studio for running the frontend
- Move inside the directory weather-application-frontend
- Make sure you have node installed in your system
- Run <npm install> to download all the necessary modules
- Run <npm start> and the frontend will run on localhost:3000 by default

Note: First run the backend and then the frontend to avoid any sort of error
